= Shardagnostic-Network Repository Hackage Documentation

[skip to module list](#module-list)

This site contains Haskell documentation of

* __Shardagnostic-Network__  - networking component of the Haskell implementation of Shardagnostic protocols
* __Shardagnostic-Consensus__ - Shardagnostic Consensus family of protocol which integrate with `Shardagnostic-Network`

== Module Structure And Network Components

* __IOSim & Monad Classes__

    * __[io-sim](io-sim/Control-Monad-IOSim.html)__ - `IOSim` moand which
      allows us to test networking code in simulation.
    * __[io-classes](#n.2.1.1)__ - abstract classes under 'Control.Monad.Class' which
      allow to use real `IO` or the `SimIO` monad in a polymorphic way.

* __Network__ - low level networking libraries, independent of our choices

    * __[Win32-network](/Win32-network)__
    * __[typed-protocols](typed-protocols/Network-TypedProtocol.html)__
    * __[network-mux](network-mux/Network-Mux.html)__

* __Shardagnostic.Network__

    * __ark-network-framework__ - our instantiations and implementation
      of servers, clients, abstractions for working with named pipes and unix
      sockets.  These are higher level components, which don't dependent on
      shardagnostic protocols, but build a solid foundation for the networking
      library

    * __ark-network__ - networking library which supports /Shardagnostic family
        of protocols/. It includes:

          * /Implementations, type level specifications, and api of all the protocols:/
